# Example frontend environment configuration
# Copy this file to .env and adjust the value based on your deployment target.
#
# When deploying with Docker or CapRover, set VITE_API_URL to the public URL of the
# backend service so that the static frontend bundle can reach the API.
# For CapRover this is typically the HTTPS endpoint of your backend app, e.g.:
#   https://your-backend.example.com
# For local Docker Compose usage you can rely on the built-in Nginx /api proxy
# (no override necessary), but you may set this value if your backend is hosted
# elsewhere.
VITE_API_URL=https://your-backend.example.com
